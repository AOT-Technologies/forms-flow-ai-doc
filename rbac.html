            <h1>Role Based Access Control for forms</h1> 
            <hr><br>
            <p>formsflow introduces the ability for designers to set permissions for forms, catering to both designers and client
            users. This functionality provides fine-grained control over the visibility of forms based on user roles.</p>
            <p>
                With this feature, designers using formsflow can define specific permissions with each form they create. They have the
                flexibility to determine which roles can view and interact with a particular form. By configuring these permissions,
                designers can ensure that only authorized individuals or user roles can access and work with the form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this feature enhances the flexibility and control available to designers within formsflow, empowering them to
                manage permissions and determine who can interact with their forms. It ensures that the visibility of forms aligns with
                the assigned roles, creating a more secure and tailored environment for both designers and client users.

            <br>
            <p><strong>Note</strong> :<em>
                    If existing forms are to be listed for clients, you need to migrate the existing Camunda authorizations. For this, you
                    have to run a bash script inside the FormsFlow web API. If you need to run this script in the instance or server, such
                    as a Kubernetes cluster or Nginx, you have to access the Docker container of the FormsFlow web API and execute the bash
                    script called "migration.sh". Alternatively, if you are setting up the environment locally and running the Docker
                    container locally, you can get inside the FormsFlow web API container and run the "migration.sh" command. In the case of
                    running the web API with Flask locally, you should activate the virtual environment and run the bash script within it.
                    You can create the virtual environment by following the instructions provided in the Makefile inside the FormsFlow web
                    API.
