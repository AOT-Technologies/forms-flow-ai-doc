                This project was initiated by AOT Technologies to address general-purpose end to end
                business process problems. It provides a user interface for a customer to fill and
                submit a service request form to the service provider. Service provider employees get a
                user interface through which they can process this service request. It also allows the
                service provider employees to generate reports.

            <h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
            <p>It starts with an open source dynamic form builder, a drag-and-drop user interface tool
                that allows you to create functional front-end web forms. You can easily configure the
                rules and business processes that should be triggered when the form is submitted by the user.
                Then, you&#39;ll set up the back-end, using formsflow.
