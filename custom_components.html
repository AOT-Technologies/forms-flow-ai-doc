            <hr>
            <p><strong>formsflow.ai</strong> has custom components supported which are created by
                extending the
                base components within forms-flow-forms and then registering them within the core
                renderer.</p>
            <p>Custom componets available in <strong>formsflow.ai</strong> are:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Component Name</th>
                        <th>About</th>
                        <th>How to use</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Text Area with Analytics</strong></td>
                        <td>To enable Text fields for sentiment analysis processing</td>
                        <td><a href="./custom-components/text-area-with-analytics/README.md">link</a>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table><br><br>
