                In Tasklist, you can easily create and choose filters to organize tasks based on specific criteria.
                Simply select <b><code>Create New Filter</code></b> to access a screen where you can configure filters
                according to your
                preferences, offering various options for customization.

                For versions below 5.3.0, filters can be created using the Camunda platform. Refer <a
                    href="camunda.html" target="_blank">here</a> for guidance on filter creation. If your version is
                5.3.0 or above, please refer <a href="bpm_abstraction.html" target="_blank">here</a> to a different
                section for
                the relevant guidelines.
