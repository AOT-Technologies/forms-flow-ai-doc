### Prerequisites
For docker based installation [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) need to be installed.
Admin access to Keycloak serve

### Installation
- Make sure you have a Docker machine up and running.
- Make sure your current working directory is `forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-bpm`.
- Rename the file **sample.env** to **.env**.
- Modify the environment variables in the newly created **.env** file if needed. Environment variables are given below

- Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in the browser
- Login to KeyCloak Realm with admin privileges

### Mail Configuration(optional)
- Modify the **file mail-config.properties**(under forms-flow-bpm/src/main/resources/). The default settings provided are for the Gmail server, and you need to change the credentials at the bottom of the file. Note that you want to configure your own Gmail setting to allow unsecure apps first.

### Running the application

- `cd {Your Directory}/forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-bpm`
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start.  

> NOTE : Use --build command with the start command to reflect any future .env changes eg : docker-compose up --build -d
{: .bg-grey-lt-000 .mt-8 .p-3}  

### To stop the application
- Run `docker-compose stop` to stop.  

## Health Check
- The application should be up and available for use at port defaulted to 8000 in [http://localhost:8000/camunda/](http://localhost:8000/camunda/)
