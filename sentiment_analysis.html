            <h1>Sentiment Analysis</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>Sentiment analysis is used to understand the customer's sentiments toward products, movies, and other
                such things, whether they feel positive, negative, or neutral about it. BERT is a perfect pre-trained
                language model which helps machines learn excellent representations of text with respect to the context
                in many natural language tasks.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Analysis API(link to data-analysis-api folder)</h3>
            <p>Data Analysis API is used to understand the customer's sentiments whether they feel positive, negative,
                or neutral about it. </p>
            <p>This feature requires the following env:</p>
            <pre><code>
                DATA_ANALYSIS_API_BASE_URL=http://{your-ip-address}:{port}

            <h4>Model description (https://huggingface.co/Seethal/sentiment_analysis_generic_dataset)</h4>
            <p>This is a fine-tuned downstream version of the bert-base-uncased model for sentiment analysis, this model
                is not intended for further downstream fine-tuning for any other tasks. This model is trained on a
                classified dataset for text classification.</p>

            <h4> How to use the Sentiment Analysis component</h4>
            <p>One of the unique features of the formsflow.ai framework is Sentiment Analysis. It can analyze the
                sentiment from forms based on specific topics mentioned by the designer during form creation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A form designer can drag and drop Text Area with Analytics component and associated with the
                    corresponding workflow. This activates the sentiment analysis component.

                <li>Based on the input responses of the user, formsflow.ai process sentiment associated with each user's
                    responses and the response will be patched to submission data by the Camunda listener.</li>
                    <li>The workflow associated with sentiment analysis, you need to add the java class in listeners as</li>
