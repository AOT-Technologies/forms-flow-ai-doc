## Quick installation

---

The quick-installation option saves time and labour, and is less error prone than manual installation. It helps you set up a running environment of formsflow.ai by installing the necessary packages and customizing the configuration files automatically.

### Prerequisites

1. For installation of formsflow.ai, the Docker Desktop needs to be installed (for both Windows/Linux). If Docker has been installed, and if any previous formsflow.ai installations were done already, those need to be removed from the Docker Desktop.
2. This installation is supported only by Node.js versions 14 and below (older versions of Node.js are listed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)).
