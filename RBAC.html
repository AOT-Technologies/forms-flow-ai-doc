            <h1>RBAC -Role Based Access Control</h1> 
            <hr><br>
            <p>formsflow introduces the ability for designers to set permissions for forms, catering to both designers and client
            users. This functionality provides fine-grained control over the visibility of forms based on user roles.</p>
            <p>
                With this feature, designers using formsflow can define specific permissions with each form they create. They have the
                flexibility to determine which roles can view and interact with a particular form. By configuring these permissions,
                designers can ensure that only authorized individuals or user roles can access and work with the form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this feature enhances the flexibility and control available to designers within formsflow, empowering them to
                manage permissions and determine who can interact with their forms. It ensures that the visibility of forms aligns with
                the assigned roles, creating a more secure and tailored environment for both designers and client users
