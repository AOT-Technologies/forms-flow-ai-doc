## Quick Installation
\
There are install and uninstall bash scripts included in the forms-flow-ai-charts GitHub repository that allow you to install and uninstall formsflow.ai through a short series of prompts. Once the prerequisites are met, then the forms-flow-ai-charts repository can be cloned into your local machine and the scripts can be run within the 'scripts' directory.
