                <hr>
                <p>The project was initiated by AOT Technologies as a means of addressing the general
                    situation whereby end-users fill in a form, the form is processed and there may be a
                    requirement to report on the form metrics or data.</p>
                <p>Some use cases of formsflow are:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Public submissions</li>
                    <li>FOI requests</li>
                    <li>Applications for funding</li>
                    <li>Statements of compliance</li>
