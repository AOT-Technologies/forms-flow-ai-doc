            <h1>Custom Components</h1><br>
            <hr>
            <p>One of the more powerful features of the Forms-flow platform is the ability to create your own custom
                form components. The process of creating a custom component involves extending a Base class of the
                component that is "closest" to the implementation you desire, and then override methods or introduce new
                methods that will implement your custom logic. All of the existing components within the platform also
                use this same method, so you can see the multitude of examples by inspecting how the base components for
                the Forms-flow renderer are implemented.
            </p>
            <p>In order to create the best components, it is important to understand the critical methods used to define
                a new component. They are as follows.
            </p>
            <h2>Extending Components</h2>
            <p>Every custom component will derive from a base class, whose behavior is closest to the behavior of the
                component you wish to create. It is possible to extend any other component within the Form.io renderer
                and a list of all of these components and their classes can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/formio/formio.js/tree/master/src/components">@https://github.com/formio/formio.js/tree/master/src/components</a> .
            </p>
            <p>Because of this, the first task in building a custom component is to determine which component most
                closely resembles the behavior and data model of the component you are looking to achieve. For example,
                if you wish to build a multi-button select component, it may be best to start with a Radio component
                since this is the component that most closely resembles the behavior of the component you wish to
                create.
            </p>
            <p>If you are unsure, then it is also fine to derive from the "core" components which serve as the base for
                all other components within the renderer. These core components are as follows.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <thead>
                        <th>Class</th>
                        <th>Extends</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </thead>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Field</td>
                    <td>Component</td>
                    <td>Component that derives from Component class that implements a "field" render template</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Multivalue</td>
                    <td>Field</td>
                    <td>A component that is able to implement the "multiple" configuration allowing for multiple inputs
                        for this field type.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Input</td>
                    <td>Multivalue</td>
                    <td>A component type that implements an HTML value input.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <p>Each of the components can be extended by first referencing them from the Components.components object,
                and then extending them as follows.</p>
            <pre>
                <code class="hljs">
                    const Input = Formio.Components.components.input;
                    class MyInput extends Input {
                    ...
                    ...
                    }

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>For the most generic components, it is fine to derive from "Component", but in most value components, you
                may wish to derive from the Input component.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Component Methods</h3>
            <p>Once you derive from a base component, the next step is to define methods that either override base
                behavior or introduce new behavior into the component class. It is recommended to look at the source
                code of your "base" component and the classes that it extends to understand what methods you have
                available to you, but the majority of all behavior can be achieved by implementing some of the following
                methods.</p>
            <pre>
                <code  class="hljs">

                <p>We have created a custom component for file upload for the customization of the file upload where we
                    can upload the files and save the data in a different database( maybe our own separate database).
                    Usually we save the file data in the space provided by the form.io, by implementing the custom file
                    upload, we can save the data in our own space.</p>
                <p>The File upload component UI will look like </p>
                <img src="./assets/images/custom3.png" height="400" width="800"><br><br>
                <p>We can download the file from our directory using the file name saved in form.io server.
                    In this case we have to add the server details in the .env file to which we have to send the file
                    data.
