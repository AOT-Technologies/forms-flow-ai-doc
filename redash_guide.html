                <p>The process of how to use Redash is <a href="https://redash.io/help/">well
                        documented in official docs</a>. Some of the basic steps for working with
                    Redash are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Add Data sources</em>
                        <p>You can connect with about 30+ supported data sources mentioned in docs from the
                            browser itself.

                    <li>
                        <em>Write Queries</em>
                        <p>
                            Once data is connected we can write queries. It’s always ideal to create
                            individual queries for the necessary visualizations. Writing queries is
                            a data preparation step to process data for visualization.</p>

                        <em>Create Visualizations</em>
                        <p>There are a variety of visualizations supported in Redash. Ten different
                    categories of visualization can be created with just drag and select features to
                    visualize from the queried data. Redash supports visualization types like
                    BoxPlot, Counter, BarCharts, Sunburst, Sankey, Word clouds, line charts and Area
                    charts. To learn how to create visualizations checkout Redash visualization

                        <em>Create Dashboards</em>
                        <p>You can create interactive dashboards that can be embedded anywhere and shared
                            with colleagues easily. The queries can be refreshed periodically as more data
                            comes in.</p>

                <li><em>Share Dashboad for public access</em>
                <p>Share the Dashboard and enable <code>Allow public access</code> if you wish to share the dashboard outside of formsflow.ai solution.</p>

                        To enable dashboards, and provide authorization the following changes are required
                        in
                        existing installations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a new main group called formsflow-analytics, and create as many subgroups
                            as you
                            want to associate various dashboards from Admin UI (in Designer)</li><br>

                            width="350"><br><br>
                        <li>Create a new mapper under forms-flow-web client in Keycloak by following the steps below:
                          
                        </li>

                            width="500"><br>
                        <li>Corresponding to each user, add the dashboard-groups you want to enable for
                            dashboard
                            authorization. Any user in a group given permission by the Admin to view a dashboard will then have access to that dashboard.</li><br>

                        <li>The dashboards added in the above step will be displayed in the Insights tab
                        </li><br>

                        <strong>Note:</strong>-Users who don’t belong to any group added in Keycloak will not see an Insights tab option.
