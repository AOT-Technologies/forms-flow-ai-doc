## Form Management Platform 

---
*Formsflow.ai* leverages form.io to build "serverless" data management applications using a simple drag-and-drop form builder interface.

To know more about form.io, go to [https://form.io](https://form.io/). 

### Prerequisites 

- For docker based installation [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) need to be installed.  

#### Installation  

- Make sure you have a Docker machine up and running.
- Make sure your current working directory is "forms-flow-ai/forms-flow-forms".
- Rename the file **sample.env** to **.env**.
- Modify the environment variables in the newly created **.env* *file if needed. Environment variables are given below.  

**NOTE :{your-ip-address} given inside the .env file should be changed to your host system IP address. Please take special care to identify the correct IP address if your system has multiple network cards.**
