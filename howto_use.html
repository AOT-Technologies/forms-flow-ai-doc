            <h2>Using authorizations explained</h2>
            <p>Once a Designer has created and published applications for use in formsflow.ai, online applications can
                be submitted by end users (Clients) to access forms. Rest of the workflow is based on the workslow attached to the form.</p>
            
            <p>We can broadly divide the actors or users involved as:</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/roles.jpg" height="400" width="800"></img><br><br>
            <p>Based on the actors involved, the user, group, and role creation and management are performed in Keycloak
                by the Keycloak administrator. </p><br><br>

                <h2>Using Roles for authorization</h2>
                <p>To use keycloak client with client roles for authorizations, below config map/secret entries needs to be updated with correct values;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>KEYCLOAK_ENABLE_CLIENT_AUTH: true</li>
                    <li>KEYCLOAK_WEB_CLIENTID: {project-unique-key}-forms-flow-web (mentioned in next steps)</li>
                    <li>KEYCLOAK_CLIENTID: same value as KEYCLOAK_WEB_CLIENTID. This is kept separate to support multi tenancy.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Keycloak clients and roles</h3>
                <p>3 keycloak clients needs to be created per project</p>

                    <li>{project-unique-key}-forms-flow-bpm: (Service account) with audience mapper of {project-unique-key}-forms-flow-web and {project-unique-key}-forms-flow-bpm. The service account would need manage-clients, manage-users, query-clients, query-users, view-users roles under realm management.</li>
                    <li>{project-unique-key}-forms-flow-analytics: with audience mapper of same client. This is needed only if analytics needs SSO authentication.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Default roles under {project-unique-key}-forms-flow-web. Any project specific roles has to be created under the same.</p>
